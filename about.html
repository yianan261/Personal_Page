                    <p id="aboutP" class="p-intro visible fade-in-text"> Hi! I'm Yian, currently pursuing my Master of
                        Science in Artificial Intelligence to combine my interest in AI and Software Engineering.</p>

                    <h2> How It All Started</h2>
                    <p>
                        While I attended Northeastern University, I worked as a part-time research assistant under
                        Professor Guerra Gomez in the Responsible AI project. I leveraged large language models for AI
                        incident classification as well as co-authored and co-presented a research paper that was
                        accepted by the 10th Ibero-American Conference on Human-Computer Interaction. The paper is due
                        to be published in the Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS) series of the
                        Springer Series (Stay tuned!).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I am working on a research project alongside Dr. Zhuo Feng on accelerating new
                        retrieval augmented generation techniques with Graph RAG.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my spare time, I like to work on side projects with my peers. I recently participated in the
                        2024 Gemini API Developer Competition, where my team and I developed a mobile application that
                        aggregates userâ€™s preferences and Google Maps data to generate personalized recommendations for
                        places.

                        Currently, I am also participating in the eBay 2024 University Machine Learning Competition,
                        where my teammates and I are training a model to identify motor part compatibility for specific
                        vehicles.

                    <p>
                        I keep a tech blog on Medium. I hope to help people who are just starting out on their
                        engineering journey, like I was and still am (on the journey)! Although ChatGPT is pretty cool,
                        nothing beats
                        step-by-step, follow-along images and an architecture flow diagram to help you really learn what
                        you're doing.
                    </p>

                        Little fun fact: This webpage is one of my very web first project coded from scratch using pure
                        Javascript, HTML, CSS, without the use
                        of web frameworks. For nostalgia's sake I'm still keeping it as my official page.

                    <p>There's a lot more about me than I will cover on this page. If you're interested in knowing more,
