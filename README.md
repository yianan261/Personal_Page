# Yian's Personal_Page
## Yian's personal page with HTML,CSS,JS, and Bootstrap

A personal webpage that introduces briefly about myself. I included creative addition of a random-fact generating button that would show facts about me when visitors click on it. The landing page is a simple, minimalistic page with navbar of menus of the webpage, and a picture of me, since it is a personal webpage. The navbar contains a section for About, Projects, and Contact, and Home. The About page contains a little information about myself, the Projects page consists of a carousel of images of some of my past projects. The Contact page contains some ways the visitors can contact me. The style of the personal page is minimal and simple.
